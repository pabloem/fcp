I need to develop utility that will allow copying the file from source to destination.
The following are the requirements:
1.  The utility will perform Copy and Move operations
2.  The utility will allow full command line control
3.  The utility will support the command line keys: Overwrite, Unattended, Help, Bandwidth, TxtLog, SNMPLog, UILog
4.  Overwrite key will cause the utility to overwrite the destination file
5.  Unattended key will cause the utility to not display any UI
6.  Help key will display help for the utility
7.  Bandwidth key will allow setting the maximum network bandwidth used by utility (for example: /bandwidth=100 â€“ in kbp/s) 
8.  TxtLog key will allow setting the log location (for example: c:\tmp\log.txt)
9.  SNMPLog key will cause reporting by SNMP traps
10. UILog key will display the log values in sysout window
11. The following are the values that needed to be logged:
1)  percent of proceed
2)  volume
3)  time estimation for finish
4)  time of start
5)  average speed of file transfer
12. The utility will allow unattended mode
13. The utility will allow controlling the network bandwidth which will be used to copy the file
14. The utility will allow using all the available network bandwidth for copy operation
15. The utility will report any problem by SNMP trap 
16. The utility will report any problem by using log entry
17. The utility will allow resuming from the same point it stopped when the problem occurs
18. The utility will allow stopping or pausing
19. The code will be owned by the customer
20. Design and Code review will be performed during the project and the milestone will be paid according to it
